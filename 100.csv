In truth, this actually isn't everyday violence -- it's more than everyday. In the 274 days of 2015, we've had 294 mass shootings. And 986 since Sandy Hook in 2012. The question is, when will our level of disgust be high enough that we do what's needed to lower the body count? ""If you think this is a problem,"" said the president, ""then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.""

As many tried to explain away Trump's reckless, racist extremism, a few put principle over party. The wife of former Republican Senator Bob Bennett, who died on May 4, revealed that her husband spent his dying hours reaching out to Muslims. ""He would go to people with the hijab [on] and tell them he was glad they were in America,"" she told the Daily Beast. ""He wanted to apologize on behalf of the Republican Party."" In the U.K., Prime Minister David Cameron called Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., ""divisive, stupid and wrong."" Trump's reply was that he didn't think he and Cameron would ""have a very good relationship."" The press is also doing its part to whitewash extremism. The New York Times called Trump's racism ""a reductive approach to ethnicity,"" and said Trump's attitude toward women is ""complex"" and ""defies simple categorization,"" as if sexism is suddenly as complicated as string theory. Not everybody's going along. Bob Garfield, co-host of ""On the Media,"" warned the press of the danger of normalizing Trump. ""Every interview with Donald Trump, every single one should hold him accountable for bigotry, incitement, juvenile conduct and blithe contempt for the Constitution,"" he said. ""The voters will do what the voters will do, but it must not be, cannot be because the press did not do enough.""",2016-05-22

On Thursday, Trump met with Paul Ryan, with the two calling the talk a ""positive step toward unification,"" and Ryan adding that Trump is a ""very warm and genuine person."" If Ryan ends up endorsing Trump, he must be held accountable for what he's endorsing. As Senator Harry Reid said of his GOP counterpart, ""Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, you can only assume he agrees with Trump's view that women are dogs and pigs."" Rough stuff but he has a point: You either believe we should deport 12 million people or you don't. You either believe there should be a religious test to enter the U.S. or you don't. But the GOP isn't alone in its attempts to white-wash Trump. The New York Times referred to Trump's racism as ""a reductive approach to ethnicity.""

First, House Republicans voted to sue President Obama for using executive authority to delay implementation of the health care law they've held over 50 votes to repeal. Then, after a revolt in their own ranks, House leadership withdrew their bill to deal with the border crisis -- then issued a jaw-dropping statement urging the president to (wait for it... ) use executive authority ""without congressional action."" But on Friday, after worsening an already bad bill by weakening protections for the children at the center of the crisis, they finally passed a symbolic and useless package -- useless since their Republican counterparts in the Senate already torpedoed that chamber's $2.7 billion border crisis bill. Their ""work"" done, they recessed for a five-week vacation -- during which they will no doubt fundraise, using the ""crisis"" they've failed to address as fodder.

In a speech on Thursday, she called out governors Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, and Jeb Bush, demanding Republicans ""stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud, and start explaining why they're so scared of letting citizens have their say."" She followed it up with sensible proposals to make voting easier. Meanwhile, speaking of wars, on Monday Senator Lindsey Graham -- whose solution to every foreign policy problem boils down to armed conflict -- entered the 2016 race. Right on cue, three days later, responding to a question about the fact that Americans are tired of endless war, Graham said, ""Well don't vote for me."" Duly noted.
